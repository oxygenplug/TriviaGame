# TriviaGame by Daniel Garces

This is a small game I created as a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp at the University of Miami.   
The game gives you 60 seconds to answer 10 questions. There are two ways to reach the end of the game:  
- The time expires
- You reach the end of the questions and click on the submit button  
  
Once you reach the end of the game you are presented with the total amount you got correct, total amount you got wrong,
and the total amount of questions you answered out of the total. You can change your answers while the timer is running
and before you hit submit however selecting an incorrect answer will count towards your total of wrongs guesses.
